# About this project

This is a simple react context api implementation using typescript and json placeholder to fetch data from an api and display.

This project is designed using react typescript boilerplate with the proper implementation of react context api & and fetching data from api service(json placeholder) using typescript. You can fine-tune this code to suit your desire. The folder structure is simple to understand and i have tried my best to keep everything simple. Unit & integration tests have been implemented using react testing library.

This mini project fetches data from an api [Json Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)and display in the webpage. Instead of keeping the state management locally, i decided to globalize it using the react context api which makes it simpler. Within this project you can be able to search a user by ***username*** or ***email*** or ***name*** .
